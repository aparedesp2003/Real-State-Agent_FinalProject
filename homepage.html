		<h2>My mission: </h2>
		<p>I remember that during my teenage age, my parents spent uncountable hours looking for the best place to live. 
		At some point, my parents were so tired of looking for the right home, they went through difficult times looking 
		for the right place, because they did not know how difficult the process was to find a proper house, but everything 
		changed when they decided to get in contact with a real state agent. Since that moment everything became easier for 
		my parents, and they found their dream home to place our family.</p>
		
		<p>The reason why I became a real state agent is to help families to find their dream home to live, help them during 
		the buying process, and also help them to understand the full process of buying a home and giving them the best advices 
		related to how to buy and own house in the best way possible, without any legal problem.</p>
